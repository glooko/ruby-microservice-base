docker compose build
```

```
<from project root>
docker compose up
```

#### How to stop container

* Or stop the container

```
<from project root>
docker compose down
```

#### Run tests

### Building swagger docs

We need to have SwaggerBlocks for each action in addition to the action class. Same is required for models. Also we need to add all SwaggerBlocks in SWAGGERED_CLASSES in apidocs index action. For more info check [Swagger blocks](https://github.com/fotinakis/swagger-blocks)
